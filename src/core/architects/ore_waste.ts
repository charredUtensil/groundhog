    // Assume 5 ore per stud - better ratios are available by upgrading the

    // some major issues that make ore collection excruciatingly boring:

    // 1. Assuming the player won't build a remote base (at a cost of 1 stud)
    //    and use this to "teleport" the ore back to their main base, even with
    //    an upgraded refinery each stud takes up at least two cargo spaces.
    //    This means double the trips. Even with an armada of Tunnel
    //    Transports, the game seems to take forever between the point when
    //    enough ore is available on the ground and when it's all collected and
    //    converted to studs. By this point there's really no interaction left.
    // 2. Early game takes a very long time. The player will spend much of it
    //    without a power station - which means no Electric Fences. No Support
    //    Station means no air but also no vehicles. Rubble is everywhere but
    //    there's no reward for clearing it. While this is not _entirely_ true
    //    since the rubble around the edges of caves actually does have normal
    //    amounts of ore, the player is unlikely to notice this and assume no
    //    rubble contains ore.
    // 3. Vehicle AI is bad and annoying. I frequently observed STTs picking up
    //    a single Energy Crystal, driving back to base, picking up one stud,
    //    and then driving back out to some other random cave to collect a
    //    single ore before driving back to drop all three off at the Tool
    //    Store. All the while, piles of ore sitting _near_ the base would be
    //    ignored.
    // 4. Continuing to mine after enough resources are exposed actively makes
    //    things worse - If the player doesn't turn off crystal collection,
    //    vehicles will be distracted.
